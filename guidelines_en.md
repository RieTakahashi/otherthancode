	1. When you distribute Curation as set forth in the [Terms of Use for Members](https://github.com/nordot/otherthancode/blob/master/tou_members_en.md) and the [Terms of Use for Publishers](https://github.com/nordot/otherthancode/blob/master/tou_publishers_en.md), you must place a hyperlink or a link button or area adjacent to each Lead-in, so that readers are guided to the full Story page without interruption.

		1. use of images from Lead-ins without serving the purpose of directing users to the full Story page.

	1. The following annotations of Curation are prohibited:
		1. any annotation that, in the sole judgment of Nordot, is defamatory or infringes a third party 's intellectual property, publicity, privacy or likeness rights;

		1. any annotation that is already being published as a third party 's content; and
